# UFO

Overview:
In this project, I created a table to organize UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. Then I transformed the data to a table using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript D3 library. This table will have the ability to filter data based on specific criteria such as date, city, state, country, and UFO shape.

Results:
To perform the search, user can enter their desire values on the Filter Search section-left side of the table. After entering a value, the table will automatically be filtered to match with the user's selections.
